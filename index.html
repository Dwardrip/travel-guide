          <h2>Why Brussels ?</h2>
          <h3>Brussels, the heart of Europe</h3>
    
            <p>There can be a single word to describe Brussels for tourists - Wholesome. With its brilliant architecture, innumerable museums,
            plethora of art galleries, many places to eat, multiple shops, and vibrant nightlife, Brussels is a must-visit for every tourist 
            who wishes to enjoy both culture and modernity in a single place. </p>
        
            <p>It is the capital of Belgium as well as the richest and heavily populated city in the country. 
            The city is known to be a gastronomic delight in the European Union. Alongside, Brussels also has several historic and cultural landmarks many of which 
            have landed on the list of UNESCO‚Äôs World Heritage Sites. Brussels is also known to many as the capital of comic strips because of the long tradition of Belgian comics. 
            The city lies in the north-central part of Belgium in the valley of Senne.</p>
