          <h2>Why Brussels ?</h2>
          <h3>Brussels, the heart of Europe</h3>
    
            <p>There can be a single word to describe Brussels for tourists - Wholesome. With its brilliant architecture, innumerable museums,
            plethora of art galleries, many places to eat, multiple shops, and vibrant nightlife, Brussels is a must-visit for every tourist 
            who wishes to enjoy both culture and modernity in a single place. </p>
        
            <p>It is the capital of Belgium as well as the richest and heavily populated city in the country. 
            The city is known to be a gastronomic delight in the European Union. Alongside, Brussels also has several historic and cultural landmarks many of which 
            have landed on the list of UNESCOâ€™s World Heritage Sites. Brussels is also known to many as the capital of comic strips because of the long tradition of Belgian comics. 
            The city lies in the north-central part of Belgium in the valley of Senne.</p>
